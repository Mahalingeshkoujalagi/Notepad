# Notepad

## Notepad is a basic text editor that is included with the Microsoft Windows operating system. It is used for creating and editing simple text files, such as plain text files, HTML files, and basic scripts.
### The File menu is a standard menu found in most software applications that provides options for managing and manipulating files. Some common options that you    might find in the File menu include:
## New: Creates a new document, file or project
## Open: Opens an existing file
## Save: Saves the current file
##  Print: Prints the current file
##  Exit: Closes the application

## The options in the File menu can also be accessed using keyboard shortcuts. Here are some common keyboard shortcuts that you might use to access options in the File menu:
|Function|key|
|---|------|
|New:| Ctrl + N|
|Open: |Ctrl + O|
|Save: |Ctrl + S|
|Print:| Ctrl + P|
|Exit:| Alt + F4|

## Note: that these keyboard shortcuts may vary depending on the operating system and the application you are using. It's always a good idea to check the application's documentation or help file for the most up-to-date list of keyboard shortcuts.
